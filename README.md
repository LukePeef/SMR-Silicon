**Smart Manufacturing & Robotics Silicon Project repository**
This repository is made by the students working on the Silicon project. This project will look into counting the anchors as they drop into a bucket and moving the bucket when its full. 
After this the bucket has to be replaced by an empty one. And the full bucket has to be filled with accessories and a lid can be placed on top. After that we need to look into sealing the lid and perhaps placing the bucket onto a pallet.

The code that will be placed on this repository will be about this project.
